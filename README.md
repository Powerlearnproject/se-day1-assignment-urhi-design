#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. It has helped to make work easier and faster. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
somw  few milestones gotten through materials online includes: 
1968- The first NATO Software Engineering Conference is held.
1970s- A number of new methodologies are developed, including structured programming and object-oriented programming.
1980s- The first computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools are released.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

the SDLC is the steps from the conceptualization of an idea to the implementation and testing of a software.

1. Planning: This first phase involves gathering requirements from investors, defining the scope, and planning the project, including timelines, resources, and costs.

2. Requirement Analysis: In this phase, detailed requirements are gathered and analyzed to understand what the software should accomplish. It includes identifying user needs, system requirements, and documenting them.

3. Design: The design phase transforms the requirements into a blueprint for constructing the software. This includes architectural design, user interface design, database design, and selecting technology stacks.

4. Implementation : During this phase, developers write the code according to the design specifications. It involves actual programming and converting design documents into functional software.

5. Testing: In the testing phase, the software is rigorously tested to identify and fix bugs or defects. This ensures that the software meets the requirements and is free of errors.

6. Deployment: Once testing is complete, the software is deployed to a production environment where users can start using it. This phase may also involve finalizing documentation and training users.

7. Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored for issues. Updates, bug fixes, and improvements are made as needed to keep the software functional and up to date. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfal model follows a clear plan. There is no option for going back to a step. once a step is missed. The developers cannot go back tO make change in that area. unlike the Agile methodology which allows developers to revisit a step when a bug or error is noticed.
A clear scenerio where Waterfall model should be used is in a project that has a clear goal. the requirements are already discussed and all thats left is to create the software.
While agile methodology which accept changes can be used when developing a software that the full system requirements are not fully known.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
